# Ferris on Wheels

The objective of this repository is to learn Rust developing simple applications in an order to read and develop with *The Rust Book*.

## Application List

### Initial Chapters: Basics and "Hello World"
- [ ] **Hello world!** (Chapter 1 - Introduction)
- [ ] **Hello world! 2.0** - A version that accepts command-line arguments (introduces input handling).

### Control Flow and Basic Types
- [ ] **Guessing game** (Chapter 2 - Control flow)
  - Helps understand basic concepts like variables, control flow (`if`, `match`), and random number generation.

### Types, String Handling, and Functions
- [ ] **String inverter** - Use functions and string handling to reverse a string.
- [ ] **Fibonacci generator** - Introduces recursion or iterations.
- [ ] **Terminal calculator** - Reinforces practice with mathematical operations and functions.

### Data Structures and File Handling
- [ ] **Word counter** - Ideal for working with files and data manipulation.
- [ ] **Word searcher in a file** - Adds file handling and pattern matching (regex).

### Small, More Advanced Projects
- [ ] **Random password generator** - Here you can include handling collections and more advanced random generation.
- [ ] **Unit converter** - Reinforces the use of functions and allows you to handle different numeric types.
- [ ] **Terminal To-Do List** - Introduces data structures like lists and simple storage.

### More Complex Projects
- [ ] **Pomodoro Timer** - Uses timers and may involve concurrency (depending on the approach).
