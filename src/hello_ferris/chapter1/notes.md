# Chapter 1 Notes

```rust 
println!("Something")
```
The `!` symbol refers to a macro, not exactly a function (the differences are not presented in this chapter yet).

`cargo new hello_cargo` This bash command create a new Rust project called `hello_cargo`.

Use `cargo build` to compile the program wich should be on `./src`. Use `cargp build --release` to build the program with optimizations.

Use `cargo run` to compile and execute the program.

User `cargo check` to just check if the compilation is possible, the output of the program will not be generated.
